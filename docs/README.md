# PromStack

**THIS SOLUTION IS IN BETA**

PromStack is a collection of software intended to provide a full featured platform for monitoring, alerting and logging of alerts.

> PromStack is NOT associated with the Prometheus group, though we do utilize Prometheus and their awesome software (given the name being 'Prom'Stack!)

## <a name="description"></a>Description

As mentioned before, PromStack is a collection of software intended to provide a full featured platform for monitoring, alerting and logging of alerts.  Most of the software in this collection are highly considered in their respective markets, though we still might change pieces as time moves along to optimize and offer more/better functionality as it comes along.

### A quick look at the Stack

<center>![](./images/PromStackOverview.png)</center>

#### Monitoring with Prometheus

If you are looking at this page, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) should be pretty well known to you by now.  Prometheus is an open-source monitoring solution that scrapes a configured endpoint for Metrics and allows the user to configure rules and alerts based off of those metrics.

#### Service Discovery with Consul

[Consul](https://www.consul.io/intro/index.html) is a lot of things.  However in PromStack, we are utilizing Consul for its Service Discovery via the Consul Catalog for Nodes and Services as well as the DNS provided from the Catalog functionality.  We are also utilizing the Key Value store for the promstackctl tool.

#### Alerting with AlertManager

[AlertManager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) is a tool that handles Prometheus alert events and sends the events off to receivers based on labels defined in AlertManager's configuration.

#### Logging with Alerta

An experimental piece of the PromStack, [Alerta](http://alerta.io) Python based application that relies on MongoDB.  Alerta's purpose in this Stack is to provide a logging platform for the Alerts generated by Prometheus for long-term storage.

#### Visualization with Grafana

[Grafana](https://grafana.com) is an open-source graphing tool for time series analytics.  Grafana creates be-u-T-ful graphs from Prometheus Metrics.

### <a name="status-and-contributing"></a>Status and Contributing

The current status of PromStack is that it is in **beta**.  Since there are parts that we have deemed 'experimental', we do not wish to say it is 100% stable at this time.  Though, with that being said, running these components in production should provide a stable monitoring and alerting environment, as Alerta (being the logging portion) is the only part under review.
